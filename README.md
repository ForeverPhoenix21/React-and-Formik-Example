## Description:

<p> The React-and-Formik-Example is an imput form using email and password fields. Using Formik, the form should implement the following input validation rules  
  
- If the username or password inputs are empty, display the message "Field required" under the text input.
  
- If the username is not in an email format, display the message "Username should be an email" under the text input.
  
- If the username and password pass the above validations, then display the message "Login Successful" in an alert box.  
</p>

## Installation:
<p> You can replicate this project in your favorite code editor using Formik. Create a new folder on your desktop and open the folder in your code editor. In the code editor terminal, run 'npm install formik --save'. 
  
- You can now run the program in development mode by running 'npm start' in the terminal.
